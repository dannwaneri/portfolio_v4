You want to be productive, right? You want to churn out code like there's no tomorrow and impress your boss (or maybe even yourself)? Well, I have the perfect trick for you – and it's not what you're thinking.

It's not about working longer hours, or taking fewer breaks, or drinking less coffee. In fact, it's none of those things. The key to being productive as a software developer is to work shorter hours.

That's right – by working fewer hours, you'll actually be more productive. How does that work? It's simple: by only working for a few hours each day, you'll be more focused and motivated when you're at your desk. And because you'll be working fewer hours, you'll also have more time for rest and relaxation, which will make you even more productive in the long run.
