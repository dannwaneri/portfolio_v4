# Newsletter #3 üçç

Hello, fellow pineapples,

Welcome to the third edition of the Pragmatic Pineapple newsletter!

Thank you for being here. I appreciate it! If you see something that is good or bad, please don't hesitate to respond to this email, I listen üëÇ.

## New on the blog ‚ú®

Phew, I published a lot of posts since the last email I sent you.
Here are some of the most popular ones:

### Introduction to Ruby on Rails Patterns and Anti-patterns

I started a series of posts where I go through various patterns and anti-patterns in Ruby on Rails world. If you're not using RoR on a day-to-day basis, posts from this series can still benefit you. I discuss different approaches to several common problems with the Model-View-Controller pattern. The MVC pattern is one of the most popular ones out there, so definitely [check it out on the blog](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/introduction-to-ruby-on-rails-patterns-and-anti-patterns/), and the [series here](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/tags/patterns/).

### Ethical Programming - Is It Worth It?

The questions of ethics and what's "right" always intrigued me. I decided to write a short post about it. I won't reveal any spoiler, it is best to [see for yourself here](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/ethical-programming-is-it-worth-it/).

### Improving Vim Workflow With fzf

I love Vim (if you already don't know). Another thing that I love is fzf. It is a precious tool I use every day, not just in Vim, but in the terminal as well. [Read more about it here](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/improving-vim-workflow-with-fzf/).

## Other new posts ‚≠êÔ∏è

I wrote couple of more posts, but I will just leave links to them here, not to overwhelm you in this installment of the newsletter. Here we go:

### [Setting Up Gatsby Blog From Scratch](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/setting-up-gatsby-blog-from-scratch/)

One more thing before I forget. My **talk about the history of Vim** has been out for some time now. [Check it out YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVgp0VrNo2w) if you haven't already.

That's all for now, folks. BTW, responding to this newsletter is highly encouraged!¬†
I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you just read, [so fire away that response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZmUfUBqE-s)¬†üíå!

Until next one, your fellow pineapple,
