# Gatsby to Next

Hello, fellow pineapples,

Welcome to the fifth issue of the Pragmatic Pineapple newsletter!

I‚Äôm Nikola from the Pragmatic Pineapple blog, and I will try to keep this newsletter reach you more often than before. I plan to share recent updates from my blog, plus give you some extra resources. I will share useful articles, videos, or cool content that I find interesting. Let me know what you think about it.

Let's start with what is new on the blog.

## ‚ú® New on the blog

### [How to Migrate Your Blog from Gatsby to Next.js](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/how-to-migrate-your-blog-from-gatsby-to-nextjs/)

The piece I wrote for AppSignal last year, but it got published this year. In any case, it is a good read, and it might help you decide which framework out of these two to use. I put great time and effort into it, and I hope it is helpful to some of y‚Äôall.

### [Add Newsletter Subscription Form to React Website](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/add-newsletter-subscription-form-to-react-website/)

I don‚Äôt like to put 3rd party code on my website. Most of the time, it is mangled. You don‚Äôt know what it does, and it is just not uncomfortable for me. Because of that, I decided to build and share with you how you can build a custom sign-up form for your own newsletter in React. The approach favors React, but it is easily customizable to any other React, but it is easily customizable to any other library/framework you are using.

### Share Buttons

When I started the Pragmatic Pineapple blog, I shared one article with my friend, and he immediately asked - ‚ÄòWhere are the share buttons?‚Äò. He wanted to share it but didn‚Äôt have any shortcuts.

The problem with the share buttons bothered me for a while in my head, and I decided to take some time to make them. I still didn‚Äôt write how exactly I did it, but I will in the future. For now, you can view them at the bottom of every blog post. They look like this:

![Share buttons below each blog post](./share-buttons.png)

Give 'em a click or two. Also, try hovering over them. There's a cool animation.

## üìö Useful Resources

To not clog you with links, I will share just one, but very valuable to me.

### [How to Disagree](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html)

A helpful blog post that is good to read from time to time. As part of our daily lives and work, we need to disagree sometimes. It is good to keep yourself in check and do it properly. Also, it is a valuable guide to recognize how does somebody disagree with you.

### [Nailing an Interview with Vim](https://youtu.be/mZWsyUKwTbg)

OK, I lied, one more. This one is a video of how you can nail an interview by using Vim. It is by Ben Award, and it is for all my Vim folks out there. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love it.

## üèî Summing up

Thanks for reading this, you are my inspiration. Respond if something resonated with you (or it strongly didn‚Äôt). I love hearing feedback.

Until next time, your fellow pineapple,
