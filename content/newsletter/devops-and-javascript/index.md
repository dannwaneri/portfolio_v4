# DevOps & JavaScript

Hi there,

Since the last newsletter, I published one blog post, and this one stirred up some discussions on Reddit. You'll see why, read on.

## ‚ú® New on the blog

### [DevOps JavaScript - Intro to Writing Scripts With zx](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/devops-javascript-intro-to-writing-scripts-with-zx/)

I recently started seeing an increasing number of JavaScript (and TypeScript) tools out there for DevOps. One of them is [zx.js](https://github.com/google/zx), a helper lib to make writing scripts much easier with JavaScript. In the blog post, you will get to know how to write a script in JS and all the important features of zx. Let me know how it went. Here's the Reddit [discussion in r/devops](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/tem1z1/any_place_for_javascript_in_devops_maybe_with_zxjs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Besides the new blog post, I have some interesting links for you.

## üìö Useful Resources

### [Medieval Fantasy City Generator](https://watabou.github.io/city-generator/)

Yeah, nothing too fancy here, just a generator for a city for your Dungeons and Dragons crew. It is written in [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) and it works pretty well for me. Try it out if you're into this sort of things.

### [Interview Questions to Ask Your Interviewer](https://daveceddia.com/interview-questions-to-ask-company/)

It's springtime and some folks are looking for a change. A job change, to be exact. If you have an interview soon, be sure to ask the person interviewing you some questions, it can go a long way.

But, always do it because you are interested in the answer the person is about to give you. Do not ask just for the sake of asking, it can be worse than asking no questions.

That's it for now, thanks for tuning in. Let me know how you like the new blog post and the links I shared.

Catch you in the next one,

Nikola
