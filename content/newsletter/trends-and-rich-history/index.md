# Newsletter #1 üçç

Hello, fellow pineapples,

Welcome to the first Pragmatic Pineapple¬†newsletter!

I am excited for the first issue of the newsletter, hooray! I never imagined so many people would be interested in regular updates from the Pragmatic Pineapple blog. Thank you for being here. I appreciate it! I will try to keep up the excellent work, and if you see something that is good or bad, please don't hesitate to respond to this email.

## New on the blog ‚ú®

In the meantime, I published some of the blog posts posted below:

### How Did Vim Become So Popular

I always wondered why we still use h, j, k, and l to move around in Vim. I decided to do the research and see where most of the commands and ideas in Vim come. That is how this blog post was born. Check it out if you are interested in how editors became what they are today. [Read more on the blog](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/how-did-vim-become-so-popular/).

Also, there is an interesting [discussion that happened on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23689091) about this post.

### Do Not Follow JavaScript Trends

This blog post was primarily inspired by a discussion I had with an old friend of mine. He is always following trends without stopping and thinking first. Sometimes, it all turns out good for him, but most of the time, he wishes he didn't go down that road.

The blog post itself was posted a couple of weeks ago and managed to resonate with a lot of folks. You can read the [Hacker News discussion here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23538473). How do you feel about this? Do you often fall for the hype, or wait patiently until a technology proves right?

## Coming soon ü§û

These are posts I am still working on, so please take this into account when reading them. Also, try not to share them since they are in progress and might get changed üîá.

### Why Should You Learn Vim in 2020

I am writing a post that will encourage folks to learn (or at least try out) Vim today. Everyone is aware of VSCode and how great it is, but there are still some benefits in knowing Vim. [Read the unfinished version on the blog](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/why-should-you-learn-vim-in-2020/).

### Setting Up a Simple View Counter For Your Blog

I implemented a view counter for my blog posts to better understand how many users visit the website. I am only collecting view counts, nothing else (I swear üòÇ). Also, I always wanted to have one of those view counters from the early days of the web. Unfortunately, I didn't start this blog post yet, but stay tuned and stay subscribed to get it in your inbox.

That's all for now, folks. BTW, responding to this newsletter is highly encouraged!¬†
I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you just read, [so fire away that response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZmUfUBqE-s)¬†üíå

Until next one, your fellow pineapple,
[Nikola ƒêuza](https://nikolalsvk.github.io/)
