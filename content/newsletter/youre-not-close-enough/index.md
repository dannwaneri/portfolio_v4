# You're Not Close Enough

Hi there, fellow pineapples,

Welcome to another installment of my newsletter.

Again, thanks for being here, I appreciate it. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt publish any of the blog posts on my blog in between this one and the last issue. But, I did a lot of reading and some traveling. All of this inspired me to share a couple of links below.

## [How To Understand](https://nabeelqu.co/understanding)

A month ago, I went to Budapest, Hungary. While roaming the streets and taking photos, I remembered a quote I read in this essay. It was from an American-Hungarian photographer Robert Capa and he said: ‚ÄúIf your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough‚Äù. This made me go back and revisit the essay once again.

I went back, reread the essay and decided to share with you. Whenever you feel like you don't understand something or it looks weird from afar, get closer to it, study it. The more you get closer to the subject, the better your pics and understanding of it will be.

Anyways, hope I made you want to read it, here's [the link to the essay on 'How To Understand'](https://nabeelqu.co/understanding).

## [How To Rest](https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-rest-well-and-enjoy-a-more-creative-sustainable-life)

The hustle culture, the 10x developers, the overachievers and the famous working hours of Elon Musk. We get it. Society and media reward those who know how to work well. But, rarely are those mentioned that know how to rest well.

The advice in this blog post is not to 'lay down and look at the ceiling'. Nor are they to download an app and have a guided meditation by it. No, it is about how to take rest seriously as much as you take work seriously. And how rest is not what you first think of it. Go ahead and read it carefully. You will find it refreshing.

That is all for now, thanks for tuning in. Expect new blog posts soon. In the meantime, what would you like to see me write about? You can respond to this email with the ideas.

Until next one, your fellow pineapple,
