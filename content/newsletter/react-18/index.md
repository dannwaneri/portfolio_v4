# React 18

Hi there,

Here's what has happened on the Pragmatic Pineapple blog in the last month.

## ‚ú® New on the blog

### [What's New in React 18](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/whats-new-in-react-18/)

Did you switch to React 18? They promise some sweet performance updates for free / out of the box. I wrote this piece for AppSignal's blog and it's pretty detailed. I suggest you read because it explains more than the base blog post from the React team.

And, as always, I have some peculiar links for you.

## üìö Useful resources

### [Vim Creep](https://rudism.com/vim-creep/)

Are you a user of Vim? Or have you dreamed of using it one day when you finally get the time to learn it? Then I strongly suggest you read this piece of writing. I wouldn't call it an article or a blog post - for me, it is more of a piece of art. While reading it, it sent chills down my spine.

### [Mechanical Watch](https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/)

Even if you're not a watch person, it is a must to visit a blog from Bartosz. He is insanely detailed when it comes to breaking down and explaining things. Plus, he adds a lot of animations in his blog posts so you can understand it all visually. His latest post is about how a mechanical watch works. Give it a shot.

That‚Äôs it for now, thanks for tuning in. Let me know how you like the new blog post and the links I shared.

Catch you in the next one,

Nikola
