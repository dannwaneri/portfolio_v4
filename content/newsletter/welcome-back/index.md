# Welcome Back üçç

Hello, fellow pineapples,

Welcome to the fourth issue of the Pragmatic Pineapple newsletter!

Thank you for being here. I'm Nikola and write at Pragmatic Pineapple blog. I didn't release a newsletter issue for a while now, one year to be exact. But here I am, and I have many new blog posts for you.

## ‚ú® Best on the blog

This email might as well be a year-in-review kind of an issue. But I'm not into that so much. Let's take a look at some of the highlights of the year from the blog:

### [7 Ways to Debug Jest Tests in Terminal](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/7-ways-to-debug-jest-tests-in-terminal/)

### [Four Useful fzf Tricks for Your Terminal](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/four-useful-fzf-tricks-for-your-terminal/)

## üèî Summing up

I wrote a couple of more, but I didn't release them yet. Stay tuned, and I hope you enjoy this newsletter and my content.

One thing before you leave, I want to share a great talk I found so it gives you some food for thought during the holiday season. It is called ["Preventing the Collapse of Civilization"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-SOdj4Kkk). It is about Software Engineering, even though it doesn't sound like it. It is about how we might forget what we know about software. The talk gives details on how this happened before to ancient civilizations, and we might be heading in the same direction. Give it a shot.

That's all for now, folks. Hit the reply button if you have some feedback or kind words.

Until the next one, your fellow pineapple,
[Nikola ƒêuza](https://nikolalsvk.github.io/)
