# Newsletter #2 üçç

Hello, fellow pineapples,

Welcome to the second Pragmatic Pineapple¬†newsletter!

I published some of the blog posts posted below:

### Why Should You Learn Vim in 2020

I used a bit of VSCode before, but I just could not get used to it. Switching back from Vim to VSCode, back to Vim, made me wonder why someone still wants to learn Vim nowadays? For that reason, I decided to write a blog post about its pros and cons. [Read more on the blog](https://pragmaticpineapple.com/why-should-you-learn-vim-in-2020/).

Also, there is an interesting [discussion that happened on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24064809) about this post.

### render_async 2.1.7 Lets You Retry Requests With Delay

I released a new version of [render_async](https://github.com/renderedtext/render_async) gem. If it is your first time hearing about it - its a Ruby gem that helps you make your pages faster.

## I'm speaking soon ü§û

I am happy to be a part of [VimConf 2020](https://www.vimconf.live/)! I will be talking about how Vim became so popular over the years. You can listen to my talk for free, just register on the [conference website](https://www.vimconf.live/). Get ready for some Vim trivia and fun facts!

That's all for now, folks. BTW, responding to this newsletter is highly encouraged!¬†
I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you just read, [so fire away that response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZmUfUBqE-s)¬†üíå!

Until next one, your fellow pineapple,
