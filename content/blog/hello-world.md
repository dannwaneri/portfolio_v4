Welcome to My first Blog Post. I'm going to be sharing my candid thoughts about Node.js,Typescripts and other interesting things.so if you don't like reading about Node.js and Typescript, then this isn't the blog for you.

I spend a lot of time reading blogs, and I thought it was about time that I started one myself. I don't know how often I'll write new posts, but hopefully once or twice per week. If you want to keep up with my blog, please follow me on **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/dannwaneri)**.

The goal of this blog is simple: share my knowledge and experience with others who want to learn more about what I do as a developer.

I will write articles on topics that interest me or are related to my work as a software developer.
I am not an expert, but I try to write about things that I know about. This is a blog for beginners, so if you are looking for advanced topics then this isn't the place for you.

My goal is to become a better Software developer and hopefully make some money doing what I love. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them below or on my **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/dannwaneri)** handle.

Either way, I hope you all enjoy this blog as it evolves into hopefully something much bigger!
