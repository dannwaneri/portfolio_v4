Good day, discerning reader! I'm glad you're here for my first blog post. Please allow me to introduce myself if you are new to this place. 

My name is Daniel, and as you can probably infer from my name, I'm a very sage fellow. I could tell you a long, boring story about how I decided to become a backend developer and how I got into IT in the first place, but who likes long, boring stories? Personally, I do not.

I am a backend developer from Nigeria, and it's not nearly as small or insignificant as some people might think. 

I found out that a lot of cool guys in IT have personal blogs where they write articles about things they enjoy. I want to be as cool as they are, too! 

That's why I wanted a place to post my thoughts, experiences, and all the other stuff that is on my mind.

My goal is to help developers spend less time searching through documentation/Stack Overflow/GitHub Issues/source code and more time solving business problems.
