![Geology and Code](./cover.jpg)

I was filled with enthusiasm as I returned to university for my second year. Geology was my passion, but to my surprise, there was a mandatory introductory course in computer science. Initially bursting with skepticism, I soon cultivated a genuine interest in the subject matter. Concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java, polymorphism, and the Fibonacci sequence completely captivated me. Although I had no prior knowledge of programming, I was amazed that one could type something into a command line and the program would take it as an input and produce a desired output. I was enthralled.

Despite the initial excitement that i felt upon enrolling in the course, I soon realized that it was a mind-blogging enigma.From the outset,there were various concepts and assumptions that i couldn't wrap my head around, and the teaching style employed by the instructor seemed alien to me. The sheer complexity of the course was quickly becoming too much for me to handle, and I started to seriously contemplate on quitting.

While our instructor tried her best to get us up to speed with the basics, due to the lack of access to computers in the lab, our grasp of the language and data structures remained largely theoretical. We did have textbooks to refer to, but the absence of practice left me struggling to make sense of it all, unable to fathom how the knowledge I had acquired would apply to the real world.

Unfortunately, with limited resources in the class, our understanding of Java never went beyond a shallow level and consequently, all of us were unable to construct meaningful applications, no matter how hard we tried. We were informed that further study was needed to use the language effectively, yet the lack of access to any practical experience during the course meant that progress stagnated from the get-go. This gap in our understanding, together with my poor grades, eventually led to me growing resentful towards programming.

It wasn't until after graduation, when I discovered Codecademy, that I realized my problem wasn't with programming itself; it was the way it had been taught to me. In university, the fast pace of instruction didn't give me the opportunity to digest new concepts or pause and reflect on what wasn't working. I was stuck in an environment that didn't allow for mistakes and didn't provide any real clarity.

With Codecademy and other online learning resources I slowly picked up the skills I needed, and I eventually graduated to coding things for real. Although I admit it was a long and arduous process, it eventually led me to a career in coding that I never imagined I was destined for. Now, I can look back and recognize the importance of coding and engineering from a geologist’s point-of-view – both in the field and research projects, and for the future development of the oil and gas industry.

I soon realized that many of the same principles applied to programming. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java and other coding language functions operated in much the same way as identifying strata and analyzing rock formations; from inputting data to producing a desired output. It was amazing to recognize that the same ideas we use to understand the physical world can also be applied to the digital one.

Furthermore, I began to connect the dots between programming and geology within the context of data structures. Rocks can exist as interconnected networks of fragile and robustly connected strata, and similarly, a database can utilize the same strategies of data organization and storage. With this newfound understanding, the possibilities of coding took on a new level of fascination for me.

However, the fear of the unknown still lingers as I search for my first tech job. Will I be able to succeed with my background in geology? Maybe I'll never be accepted as a programmer despite all the effort put into learning a new skill.

After all these years, I'm left wondering if I made the right decision in pursuing geology instead of computer science. But the journey has only just begun and the best is yet to come.

Who knows, maybe the skills I acquired from my degree will somehow show up in my programming career. After all, coding isn't that different from geology. A rock and a code are both made up of a bunch of tiny pieces combined together to form something bigger.
