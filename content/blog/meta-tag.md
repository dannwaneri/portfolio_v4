You want to be productive, right? You want to churn out code like there's no tomorrow and impress your boss (or maybe even yourself)? Well, I have the perfect trick for you – and it's not what you're thinking.

It's not about working longer hours, or taking fewer breaks, or drinking less coffee. In fact, it's none of those things. The key to being productive as a software developer is to work shorter hours.

I know, it sounds counter-intuitive. Surely if you want to get more done, you need to put in more time? But the fact is, working long hours is not sustainable. It's not healthy, and it doesn't lead to sustained levels of productivity. Rather, it leads to burnout. And when you're burned out, you're no good to anyone – least of all yourself.

So how do you achieve sustained levels of productivity? By working shorter hours, and taking regular breaks. Get up and walk around every half hour or so. Take a few minutes to clear your head every couple of hours. And most importantly, take a real break at least once a day – go for a walk, have a coffee, talk to a friend. Do something that takes your mind off work completely.You might not believe me now, but trust me – this is the best way to be productive as a software developer. Try it for yourself and see!
